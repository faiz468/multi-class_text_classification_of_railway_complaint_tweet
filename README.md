# multi-class_text_classification_of_railway_complaint_tweet
This project is important to simplify the process of resolving complaints reported to the indian_railway on twitter.
It separates reported tweets into complaint tweets and non-complaint tweet.
It also classifies complaint tweets into the different categories according to different departments to split the task of resolving users complaints and to speed the process.
we prepare the dataset for this problem from scratch.
we used BERT transformer in our project.

We use a semi-automated process to label our dataset, take help of zero-shot-classification model, gpt and 
also a manual check to maintain the accuracy of labelling. More Details- https://github.com/faiz468/data_labelling_for_textclassification
